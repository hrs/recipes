# Peas and Mushrooms

That old Schwartz holiday classic.

- Couple pounds of mushrooms
- A bag of peas
- "A lot" of butter
- Can of cream of mushroom soup
- Salt and pepper

Saute the mushrooms in butter. Meanwhile, cook the bag of peas.

Once they're both done, mix 'em together and add the cream of mushroom soup.
Heat to a consistent temperature and add salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
