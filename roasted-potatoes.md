# Roasted Potatoes

- 2 lb. small new potatoes, scrubbed clean, dried, and diced
- 2 tbsp. olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

Heat oven to 425°. Place the potatoes on an aluminum foil–lined baking sheet,
and toss with the oil. Season the potatoes generously with salt and pepper, and
place them in the oven. Bake potatoes, tossing occasionally with tongs, until
they are golden brown and crusty and can be easily pierced with the blade of a
knife, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove potatoes from the oven, and transfer them
to a large serving bowl or platter. Season potatoes with more salt and pepper
before serving.
