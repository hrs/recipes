# Crispy Fried Tofu

- 1 lb. extra-firm tofu
- 1/4 c. corn starch
- 2 c. vegetable oil

Press and drain the tofu. Cube tofu into bite-sized chunks.

Put the oil in a small saucepan and set the burner on high.

Combine tofu cubes and cornstarch in a sealed container (tupperware, say), and
gently shake until the cubes are covered in a thick layer of cornstarch.

Deep-fry the battered cubes in oil until golden and crispy. Drain.

(Used frying oil goes bad quickly in the fridge but lasts for a couple months in
a dark freezer. I'll usually save the excess oil in a container in my freezer
for subsequent frying.)
