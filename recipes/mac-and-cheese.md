# Baked Mac & Cheese

## For the macaroni:

- 8 oz. macaroni
- 1 tbsp. butter

## For the topping:

- 2/3 c. panko breadcrumbs
- 2 tbsp. unsalted butter
- 1/4 tsp. salt

## For the sauce:

- 4 tbsp. unsalted butter
- 1/3 c. all purpose flour
- 3 c. milk, warmed
- 2 c. shredded gruyere (cheddar or Colby work, too)
- 1 c. shredded mozzarella cheese
- 3/4 tsp. salt
- 1 tsp. garlic powder (optional)
- 1/2 tsp. onion powder (optional)
- 1/2 tsp. mustard powder (optional)

Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Add macaroni and cook per packet
directions minus 1 minute. Drain, return pasta to pot, add butter and toss until
melted. Set aside to cool while making the sauce.

Mix topping ingredients and set aside.

Preheat oven to 350°.

Melt butter over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add flour and cook, stirring
constantly, for 1 minute.

Add milk and mix to dissolve the paste into it. Whisk smooth. Mix in salt and
seasonings.

Cook, stirring/whisking regularly, for 5--8 minutes or until thickened to a
creamy consistency.

Remove from stove, add cheese and stir---the cheese doesn't need to melt.

Pour sauce into pot with macaroni. Stir quickly, then pour back into the skillet
or a baking dish. Sprinkle with breadcrumb topping.

Bake for 25 minutes or until top is light golden.

If you're prepping this in advance, store the macaroni, sauce, and topping
separately and combine when you're ready to bake.
