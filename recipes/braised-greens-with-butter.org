#+title: Braised Greens with Butter

- 1 clove garlic, peeled & finely sliced
- 1 bunch greens, washed (kale, collards, whatever)
- large knob butter
- splash sherry vinegar

To turn this into a more substantial meal, add a handful or roasted
nuts, a handful of cooked lentils or some crumbly cheese.

Heat a few tablespoons olive oil in a large frying pan with a lid.

Add garlic and cook over a medium high heat while you chop the
greens. Slice the greens crosswise, the finer you slice the quicker
they'll cook.

Add greens to the pan with a splash of water. Cover and cook over a
medium heat for 7 or 8 minutes, stirring every few minutes and adding
water if it starts to burn.

When the greens are tender, add butter and let it melt. Season with
salt, pepper and a splash of sherry vinegar or lemon juice.
