# Pineapple Peanut Stew

- white onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
- a tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 bunch kale or chard (or a bag of spinach)
- 20 oz. can undrained crushed pineapple
- 1/2 cup peanut butter
- 1 tbsp Tabasco sauce
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- salt to taste

Saute the onions and garlic for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until the
onions are lightly browned. While the onions saute, wash the greens. Remove and
discard the large stems and any blemished leaves. Stack the leaves on a cutting
surface and slice crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices.

Add the pineapple to the onions and bring to a simmer. Stir in the greens,
cover, and simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring a couple of times, until just
tender. Mix in the peanut butter, Tabasco, and cilantro and simmer for another 5
minutes. Add salt to taste, and serve.
