#+title: Peanut Butter Chocolate Pillows

Makes 2 dozen cookies.

/Chocolate dough:/

- ½ c. canola oil (vegetable oil is fine, too)
- 1 c. sugar
- ¼ c. pure maple syrup
- 3 tbsp. non-dairy milk
- ½ tsp. vanilla extract
- 1½ c. all-purpose flour
- ⅓ c. unsweetened dutch processed cocoa powder
- 2 tbsp. black unsweetened cocoa or more dutch processed unsweetened cocoa
  powder
- ½ tsp. baking soda
- ¼ tsp. salt

/Filling:/

- ¾ c. natural salted peanut butter, crunchy or creamy style
- ⅔ c. confectioner's sugar
- 2-3 tbsp. soy creamer or non-dairy milk
- ¼ tsp. vanilla extract

In a large mixing bowl combine oil, sugar, maple syrup, non-dairy milk and
vanilla extract and mix until smooth. Sift in flour, cocoa powder, black cocoa
if using, baking soda and salt. Mix to form a moist dough.

Make the filling. In another mixing bowl beat together peanut butter,
confectioner's sugar, 2 tablespoons of soy creamer and vanilla extract to form a
moist but firm dough. If peanut butter dough is too dry (as different natural
peanut butters have different moisture content), stir in remaining tablespoon of
non-dairy milk. If dough is too wet knead in a little extra powdered sugar.

Preheat oven to 350°. Line bakings sheet with parchment paper.

Shape the cookies. Create the centers of the cookies by rolling the peanut
butter dough into 24 balls. Scoop a generous tablespoon of chocolate dough,
flatten into a disc and place a peanut butter ball in the center. Fold the sides
of the chocolate dough up and around the peanut butter center and roll the
chocolate ball into an smooth ball between your palms. Place on a sheet of waxed
paper and repeat with remaining doughs. If desired gently flatten cookies a
little, but this is not necessary.

Place dough balls on lined baking sheets about 2 inches apart and bake for 10
minutes. Remove sheet from oven and let cookies for 5 minutes before moving to a
wire rack to complete cooling. Store cookies in tightly covered container. If
desired warm cookies in a microwave for 10 to 12 seconds before serving.
