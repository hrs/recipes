#+title: Tuscan Bean Soup

From Moosewood!

- 1 large onion, diced
- 2-3 medium carrots, peeled and diced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced or pressed
- 1 tbsp. olive oil
- 15 large fresh sage leaves
- 6 c. cooked pinto, Roman, or small red or white beans (that's 3 15-oz. cans,
  or about 2 c. of dry beans soaked overnight)
- 3-4 c. vegetable stock
- salt and pepper to taste

In a soup pot, saute the onions, carrots, and garlic in the olive oil on
medium-low heat until the onions are translucent and the carrots are tender,
about 10 minutes.

Stack sage leaves and cut crosswise into thin strips. Stir into vegetables.

Add cooked beans and stock.

Cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until soup is hot and simmering,
5--10 minutes.

Ladle about 3 c. of soup into a blender and puree until smooth. Stir puree back
into soup.

Add salt and pepper to taste.
