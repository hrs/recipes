#+title: Pie Crust

Adapted from the /Better Homes and Gardens/ cookbook.

For a whole pie, with a top:

- 300g (\approx 2 c.) flour
- 150g (\approx ⅔ c.) shortening
- ½ tsp. salt
- 6--7 tbsp. cold water

For just a shell, like a tart:

- 190g (\approx 1¼ c.) flour
- 75g (\approx ⅓ c.) shortening
- ¼ tsp. salt
- 4--5 tbsp. cold water

Combine flour and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Cut in shortening in pea-sized
bits (or just kinda mush it in there with your hands). Sprinkle in water and
mix, one tablespoon at a time, until all the dough is moistened.

If you're making a whole pie, divide dough into two approximate halves.
