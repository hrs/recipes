# Vegan Pad Thai

(Adapted from *Vegan with a Vengeance*)

### The sauce

- 6 tbsps tamari
- 6 tbsps sugar
- 2 tbsps tomato paste
- 2 tbsps sriracha
- ¼ c. rice vinegar
- 3 tbsps lime juice (a couple of limes)

### The rest of it

- 1 lb of rice noodles
- peanut oil
- 1 lb tofu, drained, pressed, and cut
- 1 red onion, sliced thinly
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp minced lemongrass
- 2 c. bean sprouts
- 8 scallions, chopped
- 1 tbsp red pepper flakes
- ½ c. chopped peanuts
- some chopped cilantro and lime wedges

Cook the rice noodles and put aside.

Mix up the sauce.

*Note: This recipe makes about 4 portions, but it's hard to cook more than 2 at
once! Divide things in half for cooking.*

Fry the tofu for a few minutes. Put aside.

Fry the red onion for a minute. Add garlic and lemongrass and cook for a minute.
Add the sauce, then the noodles. Cook for a couple minutes, then add the rest of
the ingredients. Garnish with the cilantro and lime wedges.
