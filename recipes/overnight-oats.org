#+title: Overnight Oats

- Â½ c. of rolled oats
- 1 c. milk (I like almond, but anything works)
- 1 tsp. flax seeds
- 2 tbsp. sliced almonds
- 1--2 tbsp. maple syrup (to taste)
- dash of cinnamon

Mix all the ingredients in a little jam jar or something similar. Stir it up and leave it in the fridge overnight to let the oats soak.

You can mix this up however you'd like, with seeds or nuts or spices or whatever. This recipe seems to last in the fridge for at least a week or so, but if you add berries or other fruit it might spoil faster, so plan accordingly.
