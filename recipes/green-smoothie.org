#+title: Green Smoothie

- Half a banana
- 3 big ice cubes
- 1 c. spinach (or mix with some kale)
- 1/4 c. frozen blueberries
- 2 tsp ground flax
- heaping scoop of protein powder (I like pea protein)
- 1 c. milk (almond, cashew, or oat are all good)

Combine everything in a blender and blend until smooth.

I'll usually prep half a dozen or so as little kits and just freeze the
ingredients, leaving out the milk until I'm ready to blend.
