# Vegetable Risotto

- 1⅓ c. arborio rice
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 clove of garlic
- 1 red pepper
- 1 green pepper
- box of mushrooms
- 1 c. peas
- parmesan cheese
- 1½ pints vegetable stock

Saute onion with garlic until transparent. Add chopped peppers and mushrooms and
saute for a couple of minutes.

Add rice, along with a pinch of salt. Saute for five more minutes.

Add vegetable stock, peas, and any other vegetables you'd like. Cook slowly on a
low heat for half an hour or until the stock has reduced away.

You can use pretty much whatever vegetables you like, so you can try it out with
your favorites. A cheap and cheerful addition is to add in a tin of chopped
tomatoes just before you put in your vegetable stock (use slightly less stock to
compensate) or drain off a tin of baked beans and add them in. You can even use
a tin of vegetable soup along with some stock for a richer taste.

Add some grated Parmesan cheese and mix it in for a creamier taste.

Once the cheese has been melted and stirred through you're ready to serve.
Sprinkle a bit of parmesan on the top and hey presto, a fine risotto.
